# df-treasure-generator-service

## About

A service implementation for the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Treasure 
Generator project.

This service may be called either from the command line as a 
local service or deployed to Heroku.

NOTE: In order to use this service you must have access to the underlying
Dungeon Fantasy Treasure library, which is not public. I am afraid that 
I am prevented by Steve Jackson Games from distributing this code. 
Please don't ask for a copy; I will not distribute it. Enjoy the service
which is available on heroku at :
